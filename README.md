# Image_classification

This was my final assessment in NVIDIA DLI Deep Learning course. Since, the dataset was huge I couldn't upload executed code on my GitHub but if you would like to try out yourself please find the dataset via the Kaggle link mentioned in the .ipynb file above.
I will soon upload more Deep Learning projects for classifying medical images, stay tuned!
Thankyou for visiting.
